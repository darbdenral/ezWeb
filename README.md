# ezWeb
 The ezWeb VisualNeo-Win-Plugin-Distribution

With this VisualNEO plugin, you can create a tiny web server to view HTML pages. This is not a web server for PHP or other server side scripts. It's built primarily for HTML & JavaScript web pages. It's has a very small footprint and uses very little memory.

You can display HTML and JavaScript web pages and access them using your default web browser via HTTP or a Web Plug-In like ezEdge using VisualNeo Win.

Configurable hostname, port and root folder. No external files or DLL's required. Download includes the server plug-in and a sample server app for VisualNeoWin.
